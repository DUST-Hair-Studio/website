### Authentication & User Management
- **Supabase Auth** handles all user authentication
- **Customers table** linked to `auth.users` via `auth_user_id`
- **Admin users** with elevated permissions and separate admin portal
- **Automatic user creation** when customers book without accounts

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Core tables
auth.users (Supabase managed)
customers (id, email, first_name, last_name, phone, is_existing_customer, auth_user_id)
admin_users (id, email, name, role, auth_user_id)
services (id, name, description, new_customer_price, existing_customer_price, is_existing_customer, is_new_customer)
bookings (id, customer_id, service_id, booking_date, booking_time, price_charged, customer_type_at_booking, status)
```

### Service Management System
Services have flexible customer type restrictions:
- **Available to both**: `is_existing_customer = true, is_new_customer = true`
- **Existing customers only**: `is_existing_customer = true, is_new_customer = false`
- **New customers only**: `is_existing_customer = false, is_new_customer = true`

Current services configured:
- **Consultation**: New customers only (free)
- **Haircut**: Both customer types (new: $225, existing: $135)
- **Short Haircut**: Both customer types (new: $175, existing: $135)
- **Bleach + Tone**: Both customer types (new: $300, existing: $200)
- **Fringe/Bang Trim**: Existing customers only (free)

## Key Features

### 🔐 Authentication System

3. **Booking confirmed** → Access to existing customer exclusive services

### Admin (Luca) Workflow
