# üöÄ Pre-Visit Checklist - Fix Payment Link Error

**Goal:** Get payment link generation working BEFORE visiting client

**Time Needed:** 15-30 minutes

---

## Step 1: Add Missing Environment Variable in Vercel ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL

This is the #1 cause of the 500 error.

```
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/
2. Sign in and select your project
3. Click "Settings" tab
4. Click "Environment Variables" in left sidebar
5. Check if "NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL" exists
   
   If it DOESN'T exist:
   - Click "Add New"
   - Key: NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL
   - Value: https://website-sigma-steel-43.vercel.app
   - Environments: Check all three (Production, Preview, Development)
   - Click "Save"
   
6. After adding, you MUST redeploy:
   - Go to "Deployments" tab
   - Click three dots on latest deployment
   - Click "Redeploy"
   - Wait for deployment to complete (2-3 minutes)
```

**Why this is needed:** Square payment links need a redirect URL. Without this variable, the system doesn't know where to send customers after payment.

**üìù Note for Production Launch:** 
When you're ready to launch on https://www.dusthairstudio.com (the actual domain from the website), you'll need to:
- Update this variable to: https://www.dusthairstudio.com
- Update Square Developer Dashboard redirect URLs
- See LAUNCH_CHECKLIST section "Production Domain Switch" for full steps
- For NOW, use the soft launch URL above for testing

## Step 2: Test Square Configuration

Visit this URL in your browser:
```

  "square_environment": "production",
  "has_access_token": true,
  "access_token_prefix": "EAAA...",
  "has_location_id": true,
