# Square POS Integration Setup

## ðŸŽ¯ **What We Just Built**

Your admin dashboard now has **two payment options**:

1. **"Pay Now (POS)"** - Marks payment as collected, use your Square POS reader
2. **"Send Payment Link"** - Generates online payment link (existing functionality)

## ðŸ“± **Square POS Setup**

### Step 1: Download Square POS App
- Download **Square Point of Sale** app on your phone/tablet
- Sign in with the same Square account as your website
- Make sure you're in **Production** mode (not Sandbox)

### Step 2: Connect Card Reader
- Purchase a Square card reader (tap, chip, swipe)
- Connect it to your phone/tablet via Bluetooth
- Test with a small transaction to ensure it's working

### Step 3: Payment Workflow
1. **Customer books appointment** (no payment required)
2. **After service**, click "Pay Now (POS)" in admin dashboard
3. **Use Square POS** to process the payment:
   - Open Square POS app
   - Enter the amount (from booking)
   - Let customer pay with card (tap, chip, swipe)
   - Payment processes through Square POS
4. **Booking automatically marked as paid** âœ…

## ðŸ”„ **How It Works**

### "Pay Now (POS)" Button:
- âœ… Immediately marks booking as "paid" in your system
- âœ… Updates booking status to "confirmed"
- âœ… Shows success message: "Use your Square POS to process the payment"
- âœ… No online payment link generated

### "Send Payment Link" Button:
- âœ… Generates Square online checkout page
- âœ… Customer can pay remotely via web browser
- âœ… Payment automatically updates booking when completed

## ðŸ’¡ **Best Practices**

### For In-Person Payments:
1. Complete the service first
2. Click "Pay Now (POS)" in admin dashboard

4. Customer gets receipt from Square POS

### For Remote Payments:

2. Share link via text/email
3. Customer pays online
4. Payment automatically updates booking

## ðŸ§ª **Testing**

### Test POS Integration:
1. Create a test booking
2. Click "Pay Now (POS)"
3. Verify booking shows as "paid"
4. Use Square POS to process actual payment

### Test Online Payments:

## ðŸ”§ **Troubleshooting**

### If "Pay Now (POS)" doesn't work:

- Check browser console for errors

### If Square POS doesn't connect:
- Ensure Bluetooth is enabled

- Verify card reader is charged and paired

### If payments don't sync:

- **Square Dashboard**: https://squareup.com/dashboard
- **Your Admin Panel**: Bookings marked as "paid"

### Track Revenue:
- Square Dashboard shows all POS transactions
- Your admin panel shows booking revenue
- Both should match for in-person payments

## ðŸš€ **Next Steps**

1. **Test both payment methods**
2. **Train staff on POS workflow**
3. **Set up Square webhooks** (optional, for automatic sync)
4. **Monitor payment reconciliation**
